## Summary
This project creates a R package that allows users to use multiple functions that describe different binomial distributions. This package has functions and methods that can create binomial objects, can calculate different probabilities based on different parameters such as the number of successes and trials and the probability of getting a single success on one trial, and can create different summary measures that describe the distribution. There are also some plotting methods for visual analysis on the different binomial distributions.
