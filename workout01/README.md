## Summary
This project is designed to explore some of the attributes in some NBA datasets of a few Golden State Warriors players in the 2016-2017 season. This project specifically looks at field goal stats of 5 different players: Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, and Stephen Curry. I applied different techniques learned in the first couple weeks of Stat 133: Concepts in Computing with Data to a real-life dataset and was able to get different visualizations and tables as evidence in a reporting article.

## Steps
The first step this project takes is to create the required files and folders in an organized shell using shell commands. Also, I initialized my git repository in the outer folder for version control. Then, I downloaded the data into the respective folder that I created in the first step and read those csv files in the R script. Then, I prepared the data by adding a few columns and merging the multiple data frames into one. Afterwards, I used this new dataset to create shot charts for each player with different visual atrributes. Then, with some table manipulation commands, I created a few efficiency tables that show the percentage of made field goals for 2 pointers, 3 pointers, and all field goal attempts respectively. Finally, I wrote an article that mixes this analysis in a reporting article.

## What I Learned
First of all, I understood how to have an organized project structure with the required folders and files to make it very easy for someone else to understand the project or even pull files from the repository. I also learned the importance of a data dictionary and I can definitely create this type of information for datasets in future explorations for other projects in other classes or even in the industry in this field. Also, I became better with Git and learned the importance of version control, especially for future assignments that may require collaboration work. I also became better using shell commands to move around directories and to move files between RStudio IDE and github. I also became better with some of the steps of the data analysis cycle with data preparation, core analysis, and reporting. I became more confident with different table manipulation commands with the 'dplyr' package and I also was able to combine information from multiple tables into one unified table for better analysis. I also become better with creating different visualizations that look aesthetic and have significant meaning for the audience. Finally, I learned how to report the findings in an intersting way by incorporating the different analysis into an interesting sports statistical article.
