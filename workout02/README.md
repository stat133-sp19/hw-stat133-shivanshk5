## Summary
This project is designed to create a visual application using the shiny package in R that creates a visual plot and a data table based on different input widgets for three different modes of investing: no annuity, annuity, and growth annuity. The 6 input widgets are slider input for initial amount, slider input for annual contribution, slider input for return rate, slider input for growth rate, slider input for years, and a select input for facet. The table and graph display the yearly balances.
